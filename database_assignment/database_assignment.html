                        Databases are a collection of information, they are
                        used for creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are many
                        different types of databases and they can be classified in a basic
                        approach of relational database or a non-relational database.
                        Relationships means a set of our data is related to another
                        of our data. Meanwhile in a non-relational database there is not
                        a common related section of our data. Our databases are put into
                        sections of data called schemas, inside each schema each data
                        is organized into tables, those tables contain columns and rows
                        to house that particular set of data.

                        large companie will have floors upon floors of just
                        database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer stores
                        information on the harddrive, we are able to create new
                        information, read information, update information and delete

                        might run into is finding the data we are looking for.
                        Imagine we had a room full of books and you were asked
                        to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well you might
                        start picking up each book, checking the title and moving
                        onto the next until you found it. Thats very slow as
                        most libraries discovered. Instead if we were to ID
                        each item we can find it quickly.</p>

                        The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a
                        storage
                        bin that hold onto all saved data. Well if only one user
                         had access
                        to that data its just like what we have built into our
                         own computers,
                        it wouldn't be useful to other users. However the joy
                        of having
                        a database is that it is a storage bin many users can
                        interact with, creating,
                        reading, updating and deleting information that all
                        users would see.</p>

                        There are a lot of large companies that specialize in
                        the storing of
                        information. As Big Data has erupted so too have the
                        size and amount
                        of companies on the market. That being said a lot of
                        their
                        software is free for most users, think of MySQL, which
                        while being an incredible
                        DB is completely free of cost and is used by a large
                        company called
                        Facebook.</p>
